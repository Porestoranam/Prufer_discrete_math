# Prufer_discrete_math


The program can create tree graph and visualize it by Prufer code. Also the program builds Prufer code by adjacency list. The project was implemented using jupiter notebook. The construction of the Pu–≥fer code for a given tree and the restoration of a tree by its code is performed with asymptotic complexity O(n) with using O(n) additional memory.

To start you should to download the jupyter. Then you can clone this repository and follow instructions there.

The program Build_Prufer_tree takes as input a sequence of positive integers of length n, each of whose elements is less or equal than n + 2. If the input is incorrect, the program outputs a message of error. If input is correct, the program outputs a tree (with numbered vertices).

The program Prufer_encode takes as input number of vertices and adjacency list of your tree. If the input is correct, the output will be Prufer code of the tree. Else the output is a message of error. 

This program was prepared in frame of the course 'Discrete analysis' in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Website of the course: https://mipt.ru/education/chairs/dm/education/courses/common_courses/year2/diskretnyy-analiz-2017-18.php. The program illustrates relation between trees and numerical sequences by using Prufer code.
